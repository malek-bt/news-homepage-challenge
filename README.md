# News Homepage Challenge

This is my submission for the [News homepage challenge from Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/news-homepage-H6SWTa1MFl), done with Next.js 

## Description

The News Homepage Challenge is a design challenge where participants are given a design for a news website's homepage and are asked to recreate it using HTML, CSS, and possibly JavaScript. For this particular submission, I used Next.js to build the application.
